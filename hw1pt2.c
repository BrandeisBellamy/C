/*
09/13/2018 Interest Calculator
The simple interest on a loan is calculated by the formula interest = principal * rate * days / 365; 
The preceding formula assumes that rate is the annual interest rate, and therefore includes the division by 365 (days). 
Develop a program that will input principal, rate and days for several loans, and will calculate and display the simple interest for each loan, 
using the preceding formula.
